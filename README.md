# Logistics Engineering Problems

In this repository, some typical logistic engineering problems have been solved. Its execution has been carried out in the Google Colab platform under the Python programming language and some derived mathematical modeling tools.

The problems solved here are typical cases, set in a university theoretical framework. This means that they are quite simple, focused on understanding the mathematical modeling for their development.

# Evaluated problems

* Minimum Cost Maximum Flow Problem
* Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem
* P-Median Problem
